Okay, I've reviewed the main plugin file optima-woocommerce.php. Here are some initial observations and potential areas for improvement:

Dependency Check (Guzzle): The check for vendor/autoload.php is good, but it could be more robust by checking if the GuzzleHttp\Client class actually exists after including the autoloader.
Global Variable Usage: The AJAX callback wc_optima_verify_company_callback uses global $integration;. While functional in WordPress, minimizing global variable reliance can improve code clarity and testability. Consider accessing the instance via a static method or a dedicated function if possible.
AJAX Callback Definition: Defining the wc_optima_verify_company_callback function inside the wc_optima_init function is unconventional. It's generally better practice to define functions at the top level or as class methods for clarity and maintainability.
Redundant Logic in Filter: The wc_optima_skip_zero_stock_zero_price filter seems to recalculate stock and price, potentially duplicating logic from the product sync class. It would be more efficient if the filter received the pre-calculated values.
Order Number Modification: The wc_optima_generate_random_order_number filter prepends a random prefix to the WooCommerce order number. Modifying the core order number can cause issues with payment gateways, other integrations, and customer expectations. If this prefix is required by Optima, consider storing it as custom order metadata instead.
Constants: Defining OPTIMA_WC_PLUGIN_FILE is useful. Consider adding OPTIMA_WC_PLUGIN_PATH and OPTIMA_WC_PLUGIN_URL constants for easier referencing of plugin directories and URLs throughout the code.
Error Logging: The wc_optima_daily_sync action currently just logs a message. Ensure that the actual sync process includes robust error logging and potentially admin notifications for failures.
Now, I'll examine the WC_Optima_Integration class, which seems central to the plugin's operation.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've analyzed includes/class-wc-optima-integration.php. This class acts as the central orchestrator for the plugin, initializing various components and hooking into WordPress/WooCommerce actions.

Here are my observations:

API Instance ($api): The $api property is private static, but it's initialized within the non-static init_components() method. This means a new WC_Optima_API instance is created every time WC_Optima_Integration is instantiated, which might not be the intended singleton behavior. If you need a single API instance, consider initializing it conditionally within the static get_api_instance() method.
get_invoice_instance() Method: This static method creates a new instance of WC_Optima_Integration just to return the $invoice property of that new instance. This is inefficient. It should likely return the $invoice property of the existing main integration instance or be refactored.
Magic Getter (__get): While convenient, using __get can sometimes obscure where properties are being accessed. Explicit getter methods can improve clarity and maintainability.
Dependency Loading: The plugin uses require_once for its internal classes. While common in WordPress, leveraging Composer's autoloader (which is already used for Guzzle) for all classes could streamline dependency management.
RO Document Creation (create_ro_document_for_order):
Hardcoded Values: Several values related to the RO document (type, payment method, warehouse ID, series, etc.) are hardcoded. Consider making these configurable through the plugin settings if they might need adjustment.
Default VAT Rate: Using a hardcoded default VAT rate (23) might be incorrect in some scenarios. A plugin setting for the default rate or ensuring the _optima_vat_rate meta is always set during sync would be more robust.
Price Calculation: The price calculation logic seems complex. Using WooCommerce functions like $item->get_subtotal() and $item->get_subtotal_tax() might provide more reliable net/gross values depending on the store's tax settings.
Hook Choice: Hooking into both woocommerce_payment_complete and woocommerce_order_status_processing could potentially trigger the RO creation twice for the same order. Review if both hooks are necessary or add stricter checks to prevent duplicate API calls.
Error Handling: The use of error_log is good. Consider adding more detailed error messages, potentially including API error responses when creation fails.
Activation/Deactivation Hooks: The logic for scheduling and clearing the daily sync cron job looks correct.
Next, I'll examine the WC_Optima_API class, which handles the actual communication with the Optima API.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed includes/class-wc-optima-api.php. This class is responsible for all direct communication with the Optima API. It handles authentication, token caching, and provides methods for various API endpoints, with a fallback mechanism using the WordPress HTTP API if Guzzle is unavailable.

Here are my observations and suggestions:

Code Duplication (Guzzle vs. WP HTTP): The most significant area for improvement is the extensive code duplication between methods using Guzzle and their _with_wp_http counterparts.
Suggestion: Refactor this by creating a single private request() method. This method would take the HTTP method (GET, POST), endpoint, options (headers, body/form_params), and internally decide whether to use Guzzle or wp_remote_request based on Guzzle's availability. This would drastically reduce the code size and improve maintainability.
Product Fetching (get_optima_products):
The current implementation attempts to fetch all products using a while loop and pagination. This can be very memory-intensive and slow for large product catalogs, potentially leading to timeouts or memory exhaustion on the server.
The default limit per page ($limit = 100) might be low; check if the Optima API allows higher limits to reduce the number of requests. The WP HTTP fallback uses a different limit (2000). These should be consistent.
Suggestion: Modify the product sync process (likely in WC_Optima_Product_Sync) to fetch products in manageable batches instead of trying to get everything at once in the API class. The API method could simply fetch one page (with a configurable limit) and return it, letting the calling code handle the looping and batch processing.
Error Handling: Error handling using try...catch and is_wp_error is generally good. Logging errors via error_log is appropriate. Ensure that error messages logged provide enough context (e.g., endpoint called, parameters used if safe).
Token Caching: Using wp_options to cache the access token with an expiry time is a standard and effective approach.
Hardcoded Values: Timeouts (e.g., 45 seconds) are hardcoded. Consider if these should be configurable via plugin settings.
Readability: The class is long due to duplication. Refactoring the request logic (Point 1) would significantly improve readability. PHPDoc blocks are present but could be enhanced with more details about parameters and return types/structures.
Overall, the API class functions but could be significantly improved by refactoring the request logic to eliminate duplication and rethinking the strategy for fetching large datasets like products.

Next, I will examine the product synchronization logic in includes/class-wc-optima-product-sync.php.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed includes/class-wc-optima-product-sync.php. This class handles the core logic of synchronizing products from Optima to WooCommerce.

Here are my findings and suggestions:

Major Performance Concern (Batching):
The sync_products method currently fetches all products ($this->api->get_optima_products(0)) and all stock ($this->api->get_optima_stock()) from the API before starting the processing loop. This is highly likely to cause performance issues (timeouts, memory exhaustion) for stores with a large number of products or stock entries.
Suggestion: Implement batch processing. Modify sync_products to loop, fetching products in manageable batches (e.g., 100-500 at a time) using the offset and limit parameters of get_optima_products. Process each batch within the loop. If possible, also fetch stock data relevant only to the current batch of products (if the API supports filtering stock by product IDs/SKUs).
Product Deletion Behavior:
Products from Optima with zero price or zero stock are currently deleted permanently from WooCommerce (wp_delete_post($product_id, true)). This might be undesirable for some users who prefer to keep the product history or simply mark them as out of stock or draft.
Suggestion: Add a plugin setting to control this behavior. Offer options like "Delete Product", "Set Status to Draft", "Set Status to Out of Stock".
Database Queries in Loop:
Inside the main loop iterating through Optima products, several database operations occur: get_term_by, wp_insert_term, wc_get_product, wp_insert_post, $wc_product->save(), update_post_meta. For large numbers of products, this can lead to significant database load.
Suggestion: While batching (Point 1) is the primary optimization, ensure efficient use of these functions. Using WC_Product objects and save() is generally safer and more compatible, but for extreme performance needs, direct wp_update_post and update_post_meta calls could be faster (at the cost of potentially bypassing some WC logic/hooks). The current approach is acceptable but be mindful of performance on large sites.
Stock Processing Logic (process_stock_data):
The code currently uses data from the first warehouse found for an item ($warehouses[0]). The comment mentions potentially summing quantities.
Suggestion: Clarify the intended logic. Should the stock quantity represent a specific warehouse, or the total across all warehouses for that item? Adjust the logic accordingly (e.g., loop through $warehouses and sum quantity).
SKU Handling: The fallback mechanism for missing or duplicate SKUs (using Optima ID or appending a timestamp) is a good approach to prevent sync failures. Storing the original SKU in meta is also helpful.
Category Handling (get_or_create_category): This function correctly handles finding or creating product categories.
Meta Data Storage: Storing Optima-specific details and prices as meta fields is appropriate. Consider if storing the full _optima_stock_data JSON is necessary or if just the calculated quantity suffices.
Error Logging: Logging skipped products, errors, and sync statistics is good practice.
The most critical improvement needed is the implementation of batch processing to handle potentially large datasets from the Optima API efficiently.

Next, I'll look at the admin interface code in includes/class-wc-optima-admin.php.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed includes/class-wc-optima-admin.php. This class manages the plugin's admin interface, settings, AJAX actions, and display of Optima-related data within the WordPress admin.

Here are my observations and suggestions:

Nonce Handling:
Nonce checks (wp_verify_nonce) are present in most AJAX handlers, which is good for security.
However, there's some inconsistency and potential duplication in nonce creation within wp_localize_script. For example, ro_nonce is defined twice.
Suggestion: Use distinct nonce actions for each AJAX handler (e.g., wc_optima_fetch_customers_nonce, wc_optima_create_customer_nonce, wc_optima_search_ro_nonce, etc.) both in wp_localize_script and in the corresponding AJAX handler checks. This improves security clarity.
Capability Checks: AJAX handlers currently only check nonces. They should also verify if the current user has the appropriate capability (e.g., manage_woocommerce or a custom capability) before performing actions, especially actions that modify data or fetch potentially sensitive information.
Suggestion: Add current_user_can('manage_woocommerce') checks (or a more specific capability if defined) at the beginning of each AJAX handler.
API Instance Retrieval: AJAX handlers use WC_Optima_Integration::get_api_instance(). As noted previously, the way the static $api property is handled in WC_Optima_Integration might be problematic. Ensure this reliably returns the correct, initialized API instance.
Admin Page Structure (admin_page):
The admin page uses a series of if/elseif blocks based on the $_GET['tab'] parameter to display different sections. This is functional but can become cumbersome as more tabs are added.
Consider structuring each tab's content into separate private methods within the WC_Optima_Admin class (e.g., display_sync_tab(), display_settings_tab()) for better organization.
The HTML structure mixes PHP logic directly with HTML output. Using template files or helper functions for rendering complex sections can improve readability.
Settings Sanitization (sanitize_settings):
Sanitization using esc_url_raw, sanitize_text_field, and checked/selected is generally good.
The logic for handling the password (only updating if changed) is correct.
Clearing the token (delete_option('wc_optima_token_data')) when credentials change is a good security measure.
Localization (wp_localize_script): Passing numerous translated strings via wp_localize_script is correct. Ensure all user-facing strings in the JavaScript file (admin-scripts.js) are included here for translation.
Hardcoded Limits: The "Fetch 50 last customers" button implies a hardcoded limit (likely 50, although the API call get_optima_customers() doesn't seem to pass a limit, relying on the API's default or the implementation within that method). Consider making such limits configurable or clearer in the UI.
Cron Debugging: Displaying _get_cron_array() directly on the admin page is useful for debugging but might expose potentially sensitive information about other scheduled tasks on the site. Consider filtering it to show only wc_optima_daily_sync or placing it behind a "Debug Info" toggle.
Redundant Tabs: The navigation tabs seem to have duplicate entries (e.g., "Synchronization" and "Synchronizacja"). This should be cleaned up.
Invoice PDF Handling (ajax_get_invoice_pdf): This AJAX handler correctly delegates the PDF generation to the WC_Optima_Invoice class's AJAX method.
Path Correction: The path in wp_enqueue_script for admin-scripts.js (plugins_url('../admin-scripts.js', __FILE__)) looks correct, assuming admin-scripts.js is in the plugin's root directory and this class is in includes/.
Overall, the admin class covers a lot of functionality. Key improvements would involve strengthening security checks (capabilities), refining nonce handling, and potentially refactoring the admin page structure for better maintainability.

Next, I'll examine the JavaScript file associated with the admin page: admin-scripts.js.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed admin-scripts.js. This file handles the dynamic behavior of the plugin's admin page, including fetching data via AJAX and displaying it in tables, as well as handling PDF downloads.

Here are my observations and suggestions:

Code Structure and Duplication:
There's significant repetition in the AJAX call structure (showing/hiding loading indicators, handling success/error).
The table creation logic (displayRODocuments, displayCustomers, displayInvoices) is also quite similar (creating table, thead, tbody, iterating data).
Suggestion: Create a reusable helper function for making AJAX calls that handles the common parts (loading indicators, basic error display). Similarly, create a more generic displayTable function that takes the data, column definitions (header text, data key, optional formatter function), and the target element ID as parameters. This would significantly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
Error Handling:
Basic error handling is present, displaying messages from the AJAX response or generic errors.
The invoice section uses hardcoded English strings ("Error:", "Failed to fetch invoices", "No invoices found.") instead of the localized strings from wc_optima_params.
Suggestion: Consistently use the localized strings from wc_optima_params for all user-facing messages, including errors in the invoice section. Provide more specific error messages where possible by utilizing the response.data content from failed AJAX calls.
Nonce Usage: The script correctly uses the nonces passed via wp_localize_script. Ensure these nonces match the ones checked in the corresponding PHP AJAX handlers (as mentioned in the WC_Optima_Admin review, consider using more specific nonces).
Data Display:
Date formatting uses new Date(...).toLocaleDateString(). This relies on the browser's locale and might not be consistent. Consider using a dedicated date formatting library or passing pre-formatted dates from the PHP side if consistency is crucial.
Accessing nested properties like document.payer.name1 could potentially cause errors if document.payer is null or undefined. Add checks for existence before accessing nested properties (e.g., document.payer ? document.payer.name1 || document.payer.code : '').
PDF Download (downloadInvoicePdf):
The logic for decoding the base64 PDF data and triggering the download using Blob and URL.createObjectURL is correct and standard practice.
Error handling uses alert(), which can be disruptive. Consider displaying errors within the page structure, similar to other AJAX calls.
UI/UX:
Loading indicators (spinner) are used, which is good.
The "Fetch 50 last customers" button text implies a limit, but the code doesn't explicitly pass one. Ensure the behavior matches the button text.
The search functionality requires users to know the Optima Customer ID or Document ID, which might not always be readily available.
Overall, the JavaScript code is functional but could benefit significantly from refactoring to reduce duplication and improve error handling consistency (especially localization).

Having reviewed the core integration, API, sync, admin backend, and admin frontend, the next logical areas to examine are customer handling and registration, and potentially the invoice generation/display logic.

I'll now look at includes/class-wc-optima-customer.php.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed includes/class-wc-optima-customer.php. This class handles linking WooCommerce customers (both registered and guests) to Optima customer records, primarily during the checkout process.

Here are my observations and suggestions:

Performance Bottleneck (check_customer_exists_in_optima):
This method fetches all customers from the Optima API using $this->api->get_optima_customers() and then iterates through the entire list in PHP to find a match by email or VAT number. This will be extremely slow and inefficient if the Optima system contains a large number of customers, potentially causing checkout delays or timeouts.
Critical Suggestion: Modify the Optima API interaction. The Optima API should ideally provide endpoints to search or filter customers directly by email or VAT number (e.g., /Customers?email=... or /Customers?vatNumber=...). Update the WC_Optima_API class to include methods that utilize these specific search endpoints. Refactor check_customer_exists_in_optima to use these targeted API calls instead of fetching the entire customer list.
Guest Customer Lookup:
The logic to find an existing Optima ID for guest customers by checking their most recent previous order (wc_get_orders with limit=1) is a reasonable heuristic. However, it assumes the Optima ID was correctly saved on that previous order. If that failed for some reason, a duplicate customer might be created in Optima later.
Consider if a more robust check is needed, perhaps querying Optima directly by email even for guests if the local lookup fails, before attempting to create a new customer.
Data Mapping (map_wc_customer_to_optima):
Name Fields: The mapping currently puts $first_name into name1 and $last_name into name2. Verify if this aligns with Optima's structure. Often, name1 might be intended for the full company name (if provided) or the full person's name, with name2 and name3 for additional address lines or contact persons. Double-check the Optima API documentation for the intended use of name1, name2, name3.
VAT Number: It assumes the VAT number is stored in the _billing_vat order meta field. Ensure this meta key is correct and consistently used (e.g., by the registration forms or checkout fields). Consider making this meta key configurable in the plugin settings.
Address Fields: houseNumber and flatNumber are currently left empty. If Optima requires these, you might need to implement logic to parse them from the address_1 or address_2 fields, although this can be unreliable.
Hardcoded Values:
paymentMethod is hardcoded to 'gotówka' (cash). This is likely incorrect and should probably be mapped from the order's actual payment method or made configurable in settings.
countryCode is hardcoded to 'PL'. This is incorrect. It should use the value from $order->get_billing_country(), which already holds the 2-letter ISO code (e.g., 'PL', 'DE', 'GB').
defaultPrice is hardcoded to 0. Verify what this field represents in Optima (e.g., a price level ID) and map it appropriately if necessary.
Customer Code: The generated code WC_YYYYMMDD_OrderId seems unique. Confirm if Optima has specific requirements for customer codes.
Error Handling: The code logs an error if customer creation fails but could include more details from the API response if available.
The most critical improvement is addressing the performance issue in check_customer_exists_in_optima by using targeted API searches. Refining the data mapping in map_wc_customer_to_optima is also important for data accuracy in Optima.

Next, I'll examine the registration-related classes, starting with includes/class-wc-optima-b2b-registration.php.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed includes/class-wc-optima-b2b-registration.php. This class handles the B2B registration form, including company-specific fields and integration with the GUS API for verification via JavaScript. It extends a base WC_Optima_Registration class.

Here are my observations:

Structure and Inheritance: The class correctly extends WC_Optima_Registration (which I'll review next) and focuses on B2B-specific aspects like the form layout and company fields (NIP, REGON, KRS). It relies on the parent class for common validation (email, password) and user creation.
Shortcode and Form Display:
The shortcode [optima_b2b_registration] is registered correctly.
The form (display_registration_form) includes necessary fields for B2B registration, including company details and a "Verify Company" button, presumably linked to the GUS API via JavaScript (registration-validation.js) and an AJAX handler (wc_optima_verify_company).
It correctly handles displaying errors or success messages with redirects.
Improvement: The links for "regulamin" and "polityka prywatności" are hardcoded (/regulamin/, /polityka-prywatnosci/). It's better practice to use WordPress functions like get_permalink(get_page_by_path('regulamin')) or store these page IDs/slugs in plugin settings to avoid broken links if the page slugs change.
Form Processing (process_registration):
Nonce verification (wc_optima_b2b_register_nonce) is implemented correctly.
Input validation covers required fields, NIP format (delegated to $gus_api), email, password strength, and password match (delegated to parent methods).
Sanitization (sanitize_text_field, sanitize_email) is used appropriately before creating the user and saving meta.
User creation is delegated to the parent create_user method.
B2B-specific user meta (_optima_company_name, _optima_nip, etc.) and standard WooCommerce billing meta (billing_company) are saved correctly.
Automatic login after registration (wp_set_auth_cookie) is standard practice.
Scripts and Localization: Scripts and styles are enqueued correctly for the shortcode. wp_localize_script is used effectively to pass AJAX parameters (URL, nonce) and translated strings for validation messages and UI elements to the JavaScript file.
GUS Integration: The class correctly utilizes the injected $gus_api instance for NIP validation during form processing. The verification triggered by the button relies on JavaScript and the separate AJAX handler.
Overall, this class seems well-structured for handling B2B registration. The main minor improvement is handling the hardcoded links. The dependency on the parent class and the AJAX/JS verification flow needs further examination.

Next, I will review the parent class includes/class-wc-optima-registration.php.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed includes/class-wc-optima-registration.php. This class serves as a base for different registration types (B2B, potentially B2C), providing common functionality like script registration, validation helpers, and user creation.

Here are my observations:

Purpose and Structure: The class effectively encapsulates common registration logic. Using protected methods for validation and user creation allows child classes (WC_Optima_B2B_Registration) to utilize them. Defining process_registration and get_registration_form as placeholders to be implemented by child classes is the correct approach for a base class.
Script Registration: Scripts and styles are registered using wp_register_script and wp_register_style. This is good practice, as it allows them to be enqueued only when needed (as seen in the B2B class's shortcode handler).
Validation Methods:
validate_email: Uses filter_var, which is a standard and reliable way to validate email formats.
validate_password_strength: Implements specific rules (length, uppercase, lowercase, number). These rules seem reasonable, but consider if they should be configurable via plugin settings for more flexibility.
User Creation (create_user):
Checks for existing email using email_exists, preventing duplicate accounts.
Uses wp_create_user to create the basic user.
Uses wp_update_user to set first name, last name, and display name.
Correctly sets the user role to 'customer' using WP_User->set_role().
Saves standard WooCommerce billing meta fields (billing_phone, billing_address_1, etc.) and the custom _optima_customer_type.
Minor Improvement: The display_name is set to first_name . ' ' . last_name. Consider if a different default display name (like the username/email) might be preferred in some cases, or make it filterable.
Abstract Methods (Placeholder): The process_registration and get_registration_form methods correctly return errors or placeholder text, indicating they must be implemented by subclasses. This enforces the intended inheritance pattern.
Overall, this base class is well-designed and provides a solid foundation for different registration types within the plugin. It follows good WordPress practices for script registration and user management.

Next, I'll examine the JavaScript validation file used by the registration forms: assets/js/registration-validation.js.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed assets/js/registration-validation.js. This script provides client-side validation for the B2C and B2B registration forms and handles the AJAX interaction for verifying company data via NIP for the B2B form.

Here are my observations:

Client-Side Validation:
The script implements validation for required fields, email format, password strength/confirmation, NIP format, and REGON format. This provides good immediate feedback to the user.
Helper functions (isValidEmail, isStrongPassword, isValidNIP, isValidREGON) encapsulate the validation logic. The NIP/REGON algorithms appear correct for Polish standards.
Error messages are dynamically added/removed next to the relevant fields using localized strings.
Code Duplication:
The validation logic for required fields, email, password, and terms checkbox is largely duplicated between the B2C (#wc-optima-b2c-registration-form) and B2B (#wc-optima-b2b-registration-form) form submit handlers.
Suggestion: Refactor this duplicated logic into reusable functions (e.g., validateRequiredFields(form), validateEmailField(field), validatePasswordField(field, confirmField), validateTerms(checkbox)) that can be called from both submit handlers. This will make the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easier to maintain.
GUS Verification AJAX (B2B):
The AJAX call to the wc_optima_verify_company action is implemented correctly, using the nonce and URL provided via wp_localize_script.
It handles displaying status messages ("verifying", "success", "error").
On successful verification, it correctly populates the relevant form fields (company_name, regon, address, etc.) with data from the response and sets them to readonly.
The feature to "Unlock Fields" after verification is a good UX touch, allowing users to override GUS data if necessary, with a clear warning.
Error handling attempts to parse the AJAX response for specific error messages and displays debug logs if available, which is helpful.
Localization: Correctly uses the wc_optima_validation and wc_optima_ajax objects for translated strings and AJAX parameters.
Server-Side Validation Reminder: While client-side validation improves UX, it's crucial that all these checks (required fields, formats, password rules) are also performed server-side (as seen in the PHP registration classes), as client-side validation can be bypassed.
Overall, the script is functional but would benefit from refactoring to reduce the duplication in the form submission validation logic.

Next, I'll examine the AJAX handler class: includes/class-wc-optima-ajax.php.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed includes/class-wc-optima-ajax.php. This class is currently dedicated to handling the AJAX request for verifying company data using the GUS API based on the provided NIP.

Here are my observations:

AJAX Handler Registration: The wc_optima_verify_company action is correctly registered for both logged-in (wp_ajax_) and logged-out (wp_ajax_nopriv_) users, which is necessary for the registration form.
Security:
Nonce verification (wp_verify_nonce) is correctly implemented, checking the nonce passed from the JavaScript.
Missing Capability Check: As this handler can be triggered by logged-out users (during registration), a capability check isn't strictly applicable in the nopriv context. However, consider rate-limiting or other measures if abuse of the GUS API endpoint becomes a concern. For the logged-in context (wp_ajax_), adding a capability check might be relevant if this AJAX action were used elsewhere in the admin area.
Input Handling:
Checks for the presence of the nip parameter.
Uses sanitize_text_field and preg_replace to clean the NIP input.
GUS API Interaction:
Correctly uses the injected $gus_api instance to validate the NIP format (validate_nip) and fetch company data (get_company_by_nip).
Response Handling:
Uses wp_send_json_success and wp_send_json_error appropriately.
Handles the case where the company is not found.
Includes debug logs in the response (both success and error) if debug mode is enabled in the GUS API settings. This is very helpful for troubleshooting.
Maps the relevant fields from the GUS API response (Nazwa, Regon, Ulica, etc.) to a simpler structure for the JavaScript to consume.
Correctly combines address parts (Ulica, NrNieruchomosci, NrLokalu) into a single address field for the form.
Error Messages: Uses translatable strings for error messages.
Overall, this AJAX handler class is well-implemented for its specific purpose. It handles security (nonce), input validation, interacts correctly with the GUS API, and provides informative responses including debug data when needed.

The next logical step is to review the GUS API interaction itself: includes/class-wc-optima-gus-api.php.


Cline wants to read this file:


Okay, I've reviewed includes/class-wc-optima-gus-api.php. This class encapsulates the logic for interacting with the GUS BIR1 API (production and test environments) to validate NIP/REGON numbers and retrieve company data.

Here are my observations:

API Interaction (make_curl, login, get_company_by_nip, get_company_by_regon):
The class correctly handles the two-step process required by the GUS API: first logging in (login) to get a session ID (sid), and then using that session ID in subsequent search requests (get_company_by_nip, get_company_by_regon).
It uses cURL (make_curl) to perform the API requests, setting appropriate headers (including sid) and handling JSON encoding/decoding.
It correctly distinguishes between production and test environments based on the production_mode setting, using different URLs and API keys (hardcoded test key 'abcde12345abcde12345' for the test environment).
The search parameters (pParametryWyszukiwania) sent to the daneSzukaj endpoint seem correctly structured for searching by NIP or REGON.
Improvement: The session ID ($this->session) is stored as a class property but isn't explicitly checked for expiry. While the GUS API session might last for a while, it's good practice to handle potential session expiry, perhaps by checking the API response for an error indicating an invalid session and attempting to re-login if necessary.
Improvement: Consider using the WordPress HTTP API (wp_remote_post) instead of direct cURL. This leverages WordPress's built-in HTTP handling, potentially offering better compatibility and integration with WordPress features (like proxy support). While cURL is functional, using the WP HTTP API is generally preferred in WordPress development.
Response Parsing:
The code correctly identifies that the daneSzukaj endpoint returns XML data wrapped within a JSON structure ({"d": "<xml>..."}).
It uses simplexml_load_string to parse the XML response and extracts data from the <dane> elements into an array.
Robustness: XML parsing can fail if the response is malformed. Add checks around simplexml_load_string (e.g., if ($xml === false) { ... log error ... }) to handle potential parsing errors gracefully.
Validation (validate_nip, validate_regon): The checksum validation algorithms for NIP and REGON (9 and 14 digits) appear to be implemented correctly according to Polish standards.
Debug Mode:
The debug mode ($this->debug_mode) is well-implemented. It logs detailed information about requests (URL, data, session) and responses (HTTP code, cURL errors, raw data, parsed XML) to the $debug_log array.
The get_debug_log() method allows other parts of the plugin (like the AJAX handler) to retrieve these logs for display.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is present (e.g., returning false on invalid NIP/REGON or failed API calls). The debug log provides more detailed error information when enabled.
Overall, this class provides a functional interface to the GUS API. Key improvements would be considering the use of the WordPress HTTP API instead of cURL and adding more robust error handling around XML parsing and potential session expiry.

Summary of Findings So Far:

I have reviewed the main plugin file, integration class, Optima API class, product sync class, admin class, admin scripts, customer class, registration base class, B2B registration class, AJAX handler, and GUS API class.

Key Areas for Improvement Identified:

Performance (Critical):
Fetching all products/stocks/customers from the Optima API at once (WC_Optima_Product_Sync, WC_Optima_Customer) is a major bottleneck. Implement batch processing for product sync and use targeted API searches (by email/VAT) for customer lookups instead of fetching the entire list.
Code Duplication:
Significant duplication exists in the WC_Optima_API class (Guzzle vs. WP HTTP fallback). Refactor into a single request method.
Duplication in client-side validation logic in registration-validation.js. Refactor into reusable functions.
Data Mapping Accuracy:
Review and correct hardcoded values (e.g., payment method, country code) and field mappings (e.g., customer names) in WC_Optima_Customer::map_wc_customer_to_optima to ensure data aligns with Optima's requirements.
Security:
Add capability checks (current_user_can) to AJAX handlers in WC_Optima_Admin where appropriate (especially for actions modifying data).
Refine nonce usage in WC_Optima_Admin and admin-scripts.js for better clarity and specificity.
Robustness:
Add checks for potential null values when accessing nested object properties (e.g., in admin-scripts.js).
Improve error handling around XML parsing in WC_Optima_GUS_API.
Consider handling potential session expiry in WC_Optima_GUS_API.
WordPress Best Practices:
Consider replacing direct cURL calls with the WordPress HTTP API (wp_remote_post/wp_remote_get) in WC_Optima_GUS_API.
Replace hardcoded URLs/slugs (e.g., for privacy policy pages) with dynamic methods (get_permalink).
Configuration:
Make behaviors like product deletion (on zero stock/price) configurable via settings.
Make hardcoded values (e.g., default VAT rate, API timeouts, RO document defaults) configurable if they might need adjustment.
Next Steps:

I have reviewed a significant portion of the plugin. The remaining key areas likely involve:

includes/class-wc-optima-b2c-registration.php: The B2C registration counterpart.
includes/class-wc-optima-invoice.php & includes/class-wc-optima-invoice-history.php: Handling invoice data retrieval, display, and potentially PDF generation.
includes/class-wc-optima-company-updater.php: Logic for automatically updating company data using GUS.
includes/class-wc-optima-account.php: Functionality related to the "My Account" page.
assets/css/ files: Stylesheets.
Would you like me to proceed by reviewing one of these, or would you prefer to focus on implementing some of the suggested improvements first?


Cline has a question:
I have reviewed the core components of the plugin and identified several areas for improvement, particularly regarding performance (batch processing, targeted API calls), code duplication, data mapping accuracy, security checks, and adherence to WordPress best practices. Would you like me to continue reviewing the remaining files (like B2C registration, invoice handling, company updater, account page logic, CSS), or would you prefer to start implementing some of the suggested improvements based on the review so far?
